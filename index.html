        <h2>Non-Profit Summit</h2>
<p>Came in late. Marsh Arts Center in Berkeley has terrible wifi service for an event where apparently some folks want to be connected to the internet.</p>
<h3>Tech Soup Global</h3>
<p>Caught the post-lunch keynote, 30 min talk. Pretty interesting hearing about the work of a progressive team inside of a large global non-profit. In sum, if you believe you can deliver, push ahead and build the world you want to work in, even if it rides against the stream.</p>
<p>Really interesting content, slides are perfect notes for this circumstance, will link here. </p>
<h3>CRM breakout</h3>
<p><em>Metaphor for CRM:</em> it is like writing an outline for a novel&mdash;enough detail, but not too much.</p>
<p>Recommend: build the tiniest possible thing and starting to use it and help it grow.</p>
<blockquote><p>The most important thing about planning a CRM project is being <em>un-sentimental</em> about the organizational needs. Do not elevate ‘wants’ to ‘needs’ while also not demoting ‘needs’ to ‘wants’.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Listen for moments of surprise and encourage those. Identify warning signs early and catch them ASAP, early, without being paranoid. </p>
<p>Need to change from Technology Advocate to Subject-Matter Expert in your organization (recognize this).</p>
<p>Recognize that this stuff is only interesting to technologists / nerds, not to everyone!</p>
<p>!! Opportunity case: TI Alumni have this issue of older folks not needing some fancy things they see as young and unnecessary. On the other hand, they want to see what a new system will look like before pursuing it. Unofortunately, as the tech person has to say, if we could show you what it would look like&mdash;we would have built it already! SO, what is the use case?<br>!!! The user wants to build a <em>real</em> mock-up using an actual crm instance, <a href="http://wordpress.com/" target="_blank">wordpress.com</a>-style. This leaves the opportunity for running a simple, blog-style CRM, then upgrading for freemium features, and ultimately to move to independent instances, development contracts, etc.<br>!!! Need to investigate pantheon, aws, other drupal hosting (and cloud hosting) services to determine how to hack this with an MVP.</p>
<h4>What about modularity&mdash;why drupal at all?</h4>
<p>If you are using drupal as a brochureware, why would you bother integrating CRM? Probably you should not, unless you are doing <em>actual</em> interaction with your user, such as doing event registration, etc.</p>
<h4>Technologies</h4>
<ul>
<li>Springboard</li>
<li>Blackbaud? (Convio ancestor)</li>
<li>Salesforce (force.com)</li>
<li>Red Hen (built FDBD, for-drupal-by-drupalers, vs civicrm)</li>
<li>CiviCRM</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bay Area Video Coalition (BAVC)</h2>
<p>Jennifer Gilmen and Mark Hellar.</p>
<p>Community center in San Francisco. Support independent media, including a public access tv station&mdash;which motivated the move to drupal in the first place some years ago.</p>
<p>Center of Investigative Reporting \&amp; them are interested in measuring impact.</p>
<p>Part of documentary filmmaker coop called New Day Films, want to use drupal + salesforce, etc.</p>
<p>At the center of quite a number of different kinds of orgs. From cities to youth programs, independent producers, public meda, companies, etc.</p>
<p>Bid on SF public access TV station some years ago. AT\&amp;T rigged the laws to choke major city contracts for public access. Funding was going down to $170,000 / year, which is nothing! Not much to support all the good work they were doing there already.</p>
<p>Wanted to provide a lot of functionality for the public broadcast station, was possible due to work from the  Denver Open Media project. Needs more development!!! Contact them.</p>
<p>!! Side-note… It seems like the advantage of the html5 side of the web is that folks can access the full stack of the application and can therefore reproduce issues and do bug-fixing. However, when you have server-side software, there is a limitation to reproduce the same applications in order to actually work on them in the abstract. Some systems try to address this in some fashion that allow you to more closely reproduce the sites and applications <em>as they may exist in the wild</em> but usually it is a pain in the ass! E.g. django has fixtures, drupal has site archetypes (erg, what is the technical name for this?).<br>!!! So how to fix this? Unclear, is there a standard or simple way to make your site, private, safe, yet clonable?</p>
<p>Lots of discussion of webforms and integrating with salseforce using springboard. This is boring. Is this really the state of the art on the web for independent and public media coalitions? What is the next-generation of this type of work?</p>
<p>Honky-dory that program folks can interoperate with this system fairly elegantly&mdash;the state of the art is perhaps (not restricted but) shaped by the use of folks who are going to be implenenting programs and working on services provided by non-profits, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps it is /using/ data, visualizing it, and allowing <em>complex interaction</em>. <ul>
<li>What does “complex interaction” look like? <ul>
<li>doing lots of things with the data, storing states, allowing it to interoperate with other sources and services, being able to share and then build a review/comment layer on top of this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This is perhaps why I am very interested in using drupal as a back-end to some javascript engines like knockout.js.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>BAVC has a program for documentary filmmakers to publish and share content, which automatically gets archived in the internet archive&mdash;stored in “Community Media” archive.</p>
<p>Ideally, folks should be able to upload content to their local library, ship it to BAVC, publish to the website, and archive it with Internet Archive&mdash;<em>automagically</em>.</p>
<p>Created a website for city and county of San Francisco, <a href="http://goconnectsf.org/" target="_blank">GoConnectSF</a> with youth center digital filmmaking programs.</p>

<h2>Drupal 8 Security</h2>
<p>Presentation formatted in Ubuntu font ;)</p>
<p>Drupal.org acts as a security gateway to drupal modules, but as modules move to github/etc, we&#39;ll see the security landscape.</p>
<p>Examples of systems having their repositories compromised in the last couple of years:</p>
<h3>Versioning</h3>
<ul>
<li>FreeBSD compromised with third-party packages in conversion between cvs to subversion.<ul>
<li>Took a while to find out what had been changed due to central cvs control mechanism</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Linux Kernel: This happened a few years ago to Linux as well<ul>
<li>Luckily, with git it was relatively easier to determine if something had been tampered with</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>API</h3>
<p>Drupal - Uses PHP, Procedural hook system &gt; modularity: PSR/Symfony (paradigm)</p>
<ul>
<li>Emphasis for Drupal is to put more emphasis on the Services module, need to keep eye on REST security moving forward.</li>
<li>Comparative examples outline differences</li>
</ul>
<h3>Django vs. Drupal</h3>
<p>“The fact that Django is so object-oriented inherently reduces th epotential for vulnerabilities (even by mistake) that are often seen in other procedural code because data will typically travel through a single common layer (or class) whereby data can be cleaned, security checks conducted, etc.”</p>
<p>Movement to Object Oriented model in Drupal 8, as part of a move to professionalize PHP.</p>
<p>Speaker: “Often compared to a field of Anarchy, where things act their own way.”</p>
<ul>
<li>php == “anarchy”</li>
</ul>
<p>Lookup: “PHP: The Right Way”, www.php-fig.org</p>
<p>Dries Buytaert article on PHP over Java for Drupal</p>
<ul>
<li>More approachable for amateur programmers.</li>
<li>Also, audience of Drupal did not include conservative bodies like Governments<ul>
<li>However, since, these adopters have come.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Opportunity to standardize and professionalize the application, without becoming rigid.</li>
</ul>
<h3>API Security</h3>
<p>All have methods for filtering dangerous content.</p>
<ul>
<li>Drupal<ul>
<li>Filters on output rather than input! Same as WordPress, unlike others</li>
<li>Input filters (t(), check_plain, filter_xss, db_query); entities; form tokens; autho cookies; password hashing &amp; salting (SHA512), Twig</li>
<li>Twig is a new Drupal 8 templating framework&mdash;a dangerous attack vector.<ul>
<li>US Government found that majority of security vulnerabilities live in templates!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some good database abstraction which sort of serves as an ORM.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>WordPress<ul>
<li>Filters (wp_filter_kses(), $wpdb)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Security Management</h3>
<p>Drupal has the most active security infrastructure, especially comparative to WordPress.</p>
<ul>
<li>Security Team exists to:<ul>
<li>Resolve issues</li>
<li>Assist module maintainers</li>
<li>Documentation</li>
<li>Responsible disclosure</li>
<li>Secure coding guide</li>
<li>Provide full project review for drupal.org modules. (this security vector).<ul>
<li>Seems like it&#39;s possible to resolve this “github” issue by piping endpoints.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>WordPress<ul>
<li>Does have a security team, but they take a background role</li>
<li>Many folks seeking to do security for work</li>
<li>Don&#39;t set up monitoring, but they stop the hackers pre-emptively.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>!Idea: Java vs. PHP: Security Implications of Language Choice for Web Applications - James Walden (Northern Kentucky University). </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://freshmeat.net" target="_blank">freshmeat.net</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of focus over the years on WordPress plugins</p>
<ul>
<li>20% of top plugins, including majority of ecommerce plugins had serious vulnerabilities<ul>
<li>Researchers found that open source community did not take responsibility for security of community developments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Community Comparison</h3>
<p>Essentially, there are trade-offs between platforms from a security perspective, e.g. “ease of use” versus centralized management.</p>
<h3>Security Issue: Drupal Core</h3>
<p>Some Recent Vulnerabilities</p>
<p>Drupal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Image module<ul>
<li>Not checking whether a valid token was used to create an image derivative (could create on the fly, execute a DoS attack)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Context module<ul>
<li>Not a sufficient check whether you had access&mdash;could gain access.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>WordPress</p>
<ul>
<li>eCommerce plugin<ul>
<li>Many issues with XSS</li>
<li>insufficient level of content filtering with wp_kses_post()</li>
<li>In another point, had not checked for proper permissions to allow only ordering of published items.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Compliance</h3>
<p>FISMA, standards for government bodies</p>
<p>PCI, credit card standards</p>
<p>Lots of toggles to form compliance:</p>
<h3>Roles &amp; Permissions</h3>
<p>Drupal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very granular, but very complex that can generate vulnerabilities</li>
<li>However, this is possible to manage better with OA and WorkBench modules.</li>
</ul>
<p>WordPress has more separation of administrative layer.</p>
<h3>Federated Identity &amp; Multi-Factor Authentication</h3>
<p>Drupal</p>
<ul>
<li>OpenID, OAuth, LDAP, Google Authenticator, TFA/SmS, YubiKey, Duo, wikid, SAML: NIH Login, CAS,: OMB MAX, PIV</li>
<li>Features expanding for authentication</li>
<li>SAML and CAS are secure authentication protocols for many government agencies.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Vulnerability Assessment</h3>
<p>Drupal</p>
<ul>
<li>security review, coder/secure code review, dpscan, security scanner</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hardening</h3>
<p>Drupal</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardened Drupal, Guardr, Paranoia<ul>
<li>Guardr install profile activiates many helpful</li>
<li>Acquia maintains a great overview of security modules with Drupal Scout</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>WordPress</p>
<ul>
<li>Integrated security plugins (Better WPSecurity, BulletProof Security), Secure WordPress.A</li>
</ul>
<h3>Continuous Monitoring</h3>
<ul>
<li>By default, you often get a wealth of data which is difficult to filter</li>
<li>Collecting lots of data, but watching the important stuff allows capability of reducing threats and addressing attacks.<br>w </li>
<li>A lot of security modules are at a nascent stage.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hosting Platforms and Environment</h3>
<p>Drupal</p>
<ul>
<li>LAMP: Apache/Nginx/IIs, Mysql/Maria/PostgreSQL/MSSQL/Oracle, PHP 5.3</li>
<li>Follow fork to MariaDB<ul>
<li>Oracle was becoming less transparent in terms of security</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Drupal.org Security Incident</h3>
<ul>
<li>Breach of drupal.org, compromised</li>
<li>Had to reset passwords</li>
<li>Third-party software breached: undisclosed</li>
<li>With drupal, you never walk alone.<ul>
<li>Depending on Apache, Cash, Chef, Solar, Maria, Linux, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Security Ninja</h3>
<ul>
<li>Only possibly by effectively understanding the other components to become a <em>Security Rockstar</em>!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why users are irrational and what we can do about it</h2>
<h3>Heuristics</h3>
<p>&quot;Ferrari drivers are erratic, look out!&quot;</p>
<p>Help us make decisions really quickly — “rules of thumb” </p>
<h3>Cognitive Biases</h3>
<p>When we have a heuristic that is in some fashion illogical or erroneous</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>Different ways of displaying the expanded form of 9! yields different incorrect results</p>
<ul>
<li>Starting with 1 gives ~500</li>
<li>Starting with 9 gives ~4200</li>
<li>Total is ~ 36,000?</li>
</ul>
<p>Humans have a bias toward initial data for instance.</p>
<h4>Inspirational White Dudes</h4>

<li>Khaneman</li>
<li>Tversky</li>
<li>Thaler</li>
<li>Slovic</li>
<li>Arielly<ul>
<li>More down-to-earth, also good TED talks on irrationality</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Do we trust these folks? They are pioneers in psychology, which is convenient since there are supposedly controlled empirical experiments</p>
<ul>
<li>Pioneers of usability research /before/ it existed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many Biases</p>
<h4>Common Types</h4>
<ul>
<li>Confirmation bias<ul>
<li>Will gravitate to data that confirms existing beliefs</li>
<li>Ex: searching for “the right solution” online can simply yield the same /incorrect/ solution<ul>
<li>Designers also say, 51% are better (but is there really significance?) often in usability testing</li>
<li>Careful of body language to encourage confirmation (leaning in with a tester)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Approaches<ul>
<li>Provide answers, not raw data; provide anecdotes, not statistics; observe users not metrics</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Congruence bias<ul>
<li>People rely on direct hypothesis testing rather than indirect testing.</li>
<li>Drupal is a perfect example of this bias. There are many ways to do things, surprising sometimes.</li>
<li>Surveyed all the customers, so therefore this is what we should do (but what about the other users?)</li>
<li>Designers don&#39;t look outside of the sphere of work (pick between 3 options—but what about outside the scope?)</li>
<li>Approaches<ul>
<li>Keep eyes out for strange pathways, unnecessary solutions</li>
<li>Encourage stakeholders to broaden the base, compare against competitors and similar products, look cross-industry</li>
<li>Designers should test against competition, not within merely available options</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Curse of Knowledge<ul>
<li>!RAMPANT in the Drupal community</li>
<li>Assume huge amounts of knowledge for the users for language and nomenclature<ul>
<li>Not everyone knows what a <em>node</em> is!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Assumption that search box is always in upper right corner</li>
<li>Language like “boolean, float, integer” for fields UI&mdash;really inaccessible vocabulary</li>
<li>Designers may adopt “new icons” or new images, but is it necessarily understandable to your user?<ul>
<li>Be careful venturing out into new territory, at least use some other affordance to encourage users to break pattern</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Approaches<ul>
<li>Users should use ubiquitous patterns wherever possible</li>
<li>Use video to capture contextual inquiry to put usage in perspective</li>
<li>Test patterns you already consider “established”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Illusion of Correlation<ul>
<li>Misinterpreting coincidental events for causal relationships.</li>
<li>Users explain that one action necessarily generates another response, but may not be the case.</li>
<li>Seeing sales or traffic go down after launch of new site&mdash;maybe there are other factors</li>
<li>Changing the design and finding that it tests more poorly.</li>
<li>Approaches<ul>
<li>Ensure feedback is limited to the user&#39;s task to allow them to construct causal relations where appropriate, and not the opposite</li>
<li>Focus the question. Sales went down, but what else happened, what was going on?</li>
<li>Designers should limit the variables to ensure less convolution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Loss Aversion<ul>
<li>Folks strongly prefer avoiding losses over acquiring gains</li>
<li>Another, sub-bias is: memory of pleasant events fades quickly, versus unpleasant fading slowly.</li>
<li>Users may feel connected to things they have made, don&#39;t want to lose them</li>
<li>Stakeholders don‘t want to feel like they’ve wasted investment by throwing code away.<ul>
<li>aka “Sunk Cost Fallacy” - spent all this time working on it, so the newness “loses” all that previous investment.</li>
<li>The issue with this is not asessing the development in the context of time, that overall there are opportunities to build new things that will take less times.</li>
<li>!&quot;Your only have the future, the past doesn&#39;t exist!&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Designers get stuck to carefully-crafted elements (e.g. skeumorphic button) that add unnecessary dependency<ul>
<li>Emotional attachment, rather than ephemeral things</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Approaches<ul>
<li>Can use loss aversion in ethical and transparent ways to drive stickiness</li>
<li>Encourage stakeholders to assess future costs, rather than only past cost</li>
<li>Designers need a Zen approach to have emotional detachment&mdash;move on, create something new.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Cognitive_Biases" target="_blank">List of Cognitive Biases</a><ul>
<li>Many more!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>!Anchors can encourage the user to make a choice that seems reasonable in context, rather than actual cost and value (e.g. three options, middle highlighted). </p>
<h4>Ethical Considerations</h4>
<ul>
<li>may not be illegal or necessarily wrong, but it could be unethical.</li>
<li>Check out the [](Dark Patterns Library):<ul>
<li>Already opted-in to receiving spam emails after signing up for something.</li>
<li>This has been used for good&mdash;organ donors in Europe, opt-out system.</li>
<li>Way more organs available in Europe</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>! Metric: Consider whether your use of biases, patterns, etc in a way that is aligned with the needs of your user.</p>
<h3>Design Patterns</h3>
<p>Acquia is assembling a design patterns document. One of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#39;m worthy of your trust<ul>
<li>I say what I mean and I do what I say. It&#39;s not in my nature to trick, conceal, handwave, or manipulate. My success is directly aligned with yours and your good opinion is invaluable</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Questions</h3>
<p>Sunk-Cost Fallacy Strategies</p>
<ul>
<li>Do an actual calculation of support cost</li>
<li>However, another cognitive bias to frustrate this<ul>
<li>Folks have a tendency to value near-term costs over long-term costs. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Data Management Applications with Drupal as your Framework</h2>
<p>!Tripal - Genomics in Drupal</p>
<ul>
<li>Generic Model Organism Database - DB schema</li>
</ul>
<p>Kept building data apps, so eventually decided to make it more modular, reusable.</p>
<p>Saw drupal, has nice features:</p>
<ul>
<li>User, roles, auth</li>
<li>Forms, data handling, etc</li>
</ul>
<h3>Data development</h3>
<p>Chose to write data application without CCK, so this is all in code.</p>
<ul>
<li>Existing built-in schema update and <code>drush make</code></li>
<li>Data source/uplink:<ul>
<li>Links to outside data sources with financial info and academic data</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Upload/import w/ cron and batch</li>
<li>Create read-only data mirrors</li>
</ul>
<p>Chose drupal to make highly modular design</p>
<p>Use case requires granular access control for each module</p>
<p>Can have as many or few roles as you need, granular permissions</p>
<p>In terms of content access, can use built-in realms and grants</p>
<p>Uses Content and Forms features to develop platform</p>
<p>Advantage of Drupal is “aspect-oriented” paradigm rather than MVC</p>
<ul>
<li>Flexibility is integral, things change on a regular term</li>
<li>The module handles everything concerning the particular aspect<ul>
<li>The alumni module handles the fields, the submission, form handling, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Usage of hooks (actions) as callbacks through the standard process</li>
</ul>
<h2>Demo Framework</h2>
<p>Keeping it simple, this is fairly simple (though lengthy) install:</p>
<p><a href="https://drupal.org/project/df" target="_blank">Demo Framework</a></p>
<p>This is a way to showcase a site to potential customers quickly, not just describe drupal features.</p>
<p>Acquia is behind it, but committed to community involvement and open source—it already is open source.</p>
<p>To work with a client, ended up developing a new use case for a proper, thinner framework based on DF for sites:</p>
<p><a href="https://drupal.org/project/lightning" target="_blank">Lightning</a></p>
<p>!Basically, as far as I can tell, this project is a low-level closely drupal-integrated solution for making a data application</p>
<h2>Project Prophylaxis</h2>
<p>A <em>prophylactic</em> is a mechanism to prevent the transmission of disease.</p>
<p><em>Practicing Project Prophylaxis</em> is the practice of using legally protectie measures when working with clients by contract.</p>
<h3>Exposed</h3>
<p>You can feel exposed as a developer, designer, engineer, or even member of a new business.</p>
<p>Crowd is mostly shop owners / directors. A few contractors. One “other”.</p>
<h3>Client Relationship</h3>
<p>Consider the relationship through the entire lifecycle of the process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Choose clients wisely</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Know your skills / comfort zone</li>
<li>Align personalities / mission</li>
<li>Understand what success looks like<br>** Have metrics for success?</li>
</ul>
<p>Often, go through discovery phase, work on spec (for pay), allow room for alternative vendors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Interestingly, this is never the case.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you‘re crafting a contract, you’ll be agreeing to deliverables. Discovery phase gives a chance to get a feel for client and scope.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All those present are agile, so this is a consistent process</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How detailed is that spec?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Depends. Outline as:</p>
<ul>
<li>UX Artefacts</li>
<li>WireFrames</li>
<li>Assets</li>
<li>Tech Strategy</li>
<li>Information / content</li>
</ul>
<p>Use a boiler plate contract that effectively agrees that the client will pay. The deliverables are specified out in particular. Some use a time &amp; materials contract—hourly work, in good faith in estimates, but the client can derail at any time with crazy requests. If you&#39;re not really strict about that you can run through their budget with half a project. This is important for your record. You may be legally protected, but you have a business obligation to right somehow.</p>
<p>The message here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>There&#39;s a lot of gray area</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every client is different, need to foster the relationship while also using the same protections across.</p>
<h3>Negotiation and contracts</h3>
<p>Scopes of Work can be 20 pages long! These aren‘t necessary, detestable. As long as you have an understanding going forward, not everything has to be in the Scope of Work, you’ll have good legal protection.</p>
<p>A good lawyer is going to write a boilerplate contract in your best favor. When you go in to signing someone else&#39;s contract, be aware that they want to have an edge, have terms that are in their favor.</p>
<ul>
<li>Negotiation tips:<ul>
<li>Confidence<ul>

    <div class="entry">
      
        <p>I have found theories for social movements, especially civil rights, anti-war, and even protest generally, to be wholly insufficient to capture substantial aspects of our current struggle for openness.</p>
<p>Openness is not merely some product of technology, nor is it some new technology itself. Openness affords public good akin to notions of democracy. Both constitute negotiations of appropriate action, and fairness. We have seen various communities organize in support of openness, and it is about time we leverage this network structure&mdash;in fact there is no such luxury to wait:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Exponential Growth</strong> - The struggle for openness is directly in opposition to the desires of many incumbent institutions and firms, especially those who benefit through money and power/control. There is no time to grow linearly, even by a factor greater than one. For every interval, we need to grow at a greater rate than the previous interval. Next year, we cannot merely double, but rather, we must outpace ourselves from the previous year and prepare to grow even faster the next. This implies:<ul>
<li>Time is completely of the essence and we should be wary of delay and derailment strategies that wear us down.</li>
<li>We must be extremely clever and use all available tools to bend any of our linear growth into exponential ones such as via media that afford ease of coordination, automation and amplification, as well as both traditional and experimental funding mechanisms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Diversity of Tactics</strong> - If the first principle can be illustrated by a steep, exponential curve, then this second can be thought of through the <em>long tail</em>, the log, or exponential inverse. If we consolidate efforts and rally behind unified fronts, we can produce great results, akin to the beginning “head” component of a log distribution. However, there is substantial value in niche approaches and opportunities, the many small areas where openness can be adopted, often in unique or atypical ways. The sum of the long tail very well may be equivalent in size to the head of the curve.<ul>
<li>Consolidation can be advantageous, but exclusively it is antithetical to openness itself. It cannot be the only option.</li>
<li>Perhaps even greater than doubling impact, a diversity of tactics supports positive feedback, a range of ideas and materials that can be fed into other open initiatives in fashions we cannot predict.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Peer-to-Peer Structure</strong> - Of the many lessons learned from legacy institutions that employ closed and proprietary systems, among them is that concentration of power breeds unfairness and injustice. This lesson must be intuited for openness to succeed. Not only the concession, but the active pursuit of peer-oriented models is the only viable alternative to trading one set of regimes for another, or merely squishing regimes into a slightly smaller, but still dominant position.<ul>
<li>Thus we must address hierarchy at every level and work toward deconstructing it, even if it will take time.</li>
<li>We must also commit to resolving conflicts and disputes swiftly through solidarity since divided we currently are conquered.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<ol>
<li><em><a href="http://kopimism.org/" target="_blank">Open Access Manifesto</a></em> - Simply put, Aaron was right. This is a moral issue. We have an imperative to reject the rules, and abide by them, however we see fit, in the aim to set information free.</li>
<li><em>Public Policy</em> - It is not the sole struggle of the Openness movement to see results from the political process. All movements for social change today must confront the deep and crippling corruption of the democratic process and state accountability in a global context. We must pursue this avenue, it is not fruitless, but we also cannot lose sight of the need for our movement to operate at every level.</li>
<li><em>Infrastructure</em> - Every bit counts. When we have the opportunity, or the privilege, we must invest in building lasting, or temporary, infrastructure to support openness. This means: open a hackerspace, donate to good causes, find ways to hack livelihood for yourselves and others to do things in the open, engage in public discourse, engage in politics at the local level up, make art and express yourself creatively in ways that promote openness, buy land, buy businesses, buy banks&mdash;<em>set it all free!</em></li>
</ol>

        <p>It is true much of the journey requires travel, logistics, negotiation of new landscapes, but the wandering can feel quite good. I flew in to South London at Gatwick, made the mistake of traveling farthest from my destination, so I took a long train through london, then a connection to King‘s Cross station to Cambridge. A friend set me up for the night at his new flat, and in the morning I walked just a few blocks to the Cambridge PLOS office. It wasn’t long in the UK until I began to take issue with the absurdity of placeness here. Every tiny street has its own name, and every little building. Often place names differ completely from address, and often addresses become complex since streets need not follow conventions like odds on one side, evens on the other. And good luck finding a street sign to know where you are. It is a comical, ironical place, but I do appreciate that for the most part, places are built to human dimensions, and confusion, more than anything, stems from history, the beaten path as it were. </p>
<p>In cambridge I met some of the members of Makespace, a new hackerspace with great institutional support and a fantastic location provided through a relationship with King&#39;s College. In just a few months, the members built up quite a bit of infrastructure, providing a full toolshop including laser cutters (one in service, the other large but out of commission at the moment), 3D printer, and a store room full of all the necessary nicnacs. A clever little move was to use clear bins for member ephemera on a member shelf in the hallway—keeping things quite orderly, but transparent to get a clue onthe types of materials other members are tinkering with at the moment. The general governance of the group is odd—there are three founders who act as directors and make the necessary decisions for the space, including allocation of funds. There is some layer of trust in which members, especially those who had been around for some time, were relied upon more heavily to work things out and improve the functioning of the space. There are general discussions on the email list, and general meetings, to work out different points of view, etc. There are more than a handful systems in place to manage the space, including a sort of “training the trainer” approach that requires a designated party to train you on using specific equipment before you can take it on yourself. This is for safety, and for the preservation of the equipment. </p>
<p>I had two particularly fruitfull exchanges with folks at Makespace. First, I was barely able to make it in, save posting on a meetup event that happened to be advertised for the night I was in town. The space is not open to the public generally, only for events and member-sponsored guests. this was taken to the extreme since leaving the space required a key, or breaking the glass on an emergency exit button. When my original tour guide and host had to leave, I asked to stick around to coordinate with my local friend to crash that night, and had to be “transferred” to another member to stick around. Lucky enough, they were both very welcoming, so it wasn‘t too much trouble. On the other hand, this is yet another case I’ve found of serving member needs with little infrastructure to support public access.</p>
<p>Second, I spoke with Rachel Raynes, artist in residence with the Raspberry Pi Foundation. She makes cool exploratory things with raspi&#39;s and represents their creative side at various events and conferences, etc. She was very supportive of a bay area <a href="http://ba.chgrp.org/#outsiders" target="_blank">hacker-in-residence</a> idea, we agreed similar such opportunities are absolutely necessary both on the side of creative projects and on the side of funding out-of-the-box thinkers. Through our discussion I also got to hear of an on-going thread at makespace about how to provide access and membership. On the one hand, some contend the institutional model of garnering donations from organizations. On the other hand is the accrual of income from membership dues. the discussion on hand at the moment concerns rates, and level of access, depending on the ability to pay the membership fee. For instance, there seems to be sympathy for financial hardship, but on the other, not necessarily the same perspective for students or folks who would claim they are unable to contribute as much, generally. It is a <a href="http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/Design_Patterns" target="_blank">hacker pattern</a> to offer a full and “starving hacker” rate. Of course, patterns are not rules at all, and our different approaches to this problem fit different contexts and help inform our overall strategies. Our diversity is not only a boon, but integral.</p>
<p>Our approach at sudo room is to both provide public access as an organizational goal, and to allow for sliding-scale contributions (or hopefully non-monetary using a fair system). This addresses two complexities:</p>
<ol>
<li>How do we approach access to resources for communities that do not have or choose to exercise the privilege to enter such spaces, especially those who would very much benefit from the community and the infrastructure itself?</li>
<li>How do we make governance of the organization democratic, in a sense that all folks who use the space can have a serious voice in its functioning?</li>
</ol>
<p>I think our solution is incomplete, but am very proud of the attempted approach. It is now our responsibility to improve it and accomplish the sort of diversity of perspective, and stakholdership, that we know is necessary and fruitful overall.</p>
<p>When I made it to London, I eventually wound up at the London Hackspace, a hackerspace in Hackney. I was surprised the pun was not pervasive, but pleased enough with various other puns in the space ;). </p>
<p>First of all, this is their new location as of some time this year (I believe the spring?), and it is HUGE. If there is anyone in the UK area looking to hold some hacker event, I say lobby the London Hackspace. The entrance is in the back through a large parking lot (confusing since the whole front of the building is on Hackney street). The ground floor has a quiet room, an electronics work bench, a lounge, a recording studio, a restroom with shower, a classroom, and general hacking space. Downstairs has the biohacking space (a closet, much bigger than the former storage closet they used before—people can actually sit or stand at benches here), a woodshop, a metal shop, shelves of various materials, an open workshop area, a bicycle repair stand, and boxes of various things still unpacked from the move. </p>
<p>Chatting with a few members, I came to understand the basic governance and the history of the space. They were in a much more cramped location before, and all were glad to have moved to this new location in the same general area. Things are doocratic, encouraging folks to work stuff out on their own, and to organize together to get things they want and see things change as needed. There is a board of elected folks, with a pattern to change 3 members every year, totalling 9, and cycling at a rate of 3 years—though there is no hard and fast rule not to be re-elected for many terms anyway. This group makes financial decisions, signs necessary contracts, and resolves disputes. When they had more money in the small space, they would allocate funds to tools and projects, but now they are strapped with rent for their grand space and encourage members to find interest amongst some others, and pool some money together to buy whatever it is they need. Often things are donated, or found cheaply, so this is not too bad. </p>
<p>Over the weekend in London, I went to two hackathons, especially to meet up with <a href="http://twitter.com/evo_mri" target="_blank">Daniel Mietchen</a> to collaborate on extending a Commons media importer to upload <a href="http://github.com/wrought/open-access-media-importer" target="_blank">Open Access videos to Youtube</a>. We got a lot of work in, and started a few other good threads, but the project is not yet finished ;). The first event was <a href="http://hack4ac.com/" target="_blank">#hack4ac</a>, where participants tried to demonstrate the power and utility of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org" target="_blank">CC-BY license</a>. The next was a medical-themed event put on by BMJ at the Hub Westminster. I was very pleased with the venue, and am considering using it in the future for other events. The projects were very excellent at both events, my personal favorite the <a href="http://twitter.com/oa_button" target="_blank">OA Button</a>.</p>
<p>Before leaving, I dipped my toe in Oxford, dropping in on some Digital Humanities workshops. It was intresting to see various perspectives on digital culture and opportunities from this group. One attendee quite eloquently shared, “The only future for humanities is digital.” There is no alternative, there are many questions and much uncertainty, but the future for the humanities will not remain in analog formats. I also got a chance to talk to a PhD student who researches “Questionnaires,” surprisingly old documents, especially used by enlightenment philosophers and public intellectuals to find out about things beyond their knowledge, such as life in the “New World.” It was a rather perplexing exchange. This researcher found a series of unpublished questionnaires. There is such a great opportunity for her to reach out and find swaths of similar documents, and connect to peer researchers. However, the fixation of mining out this academic gold of unpublished source work outweighs the opportunity to collaborate in the open. This is the precise challenge of humanities work. How does one overcome incentives as strong as career fodder? Ultimately, I left my suggestion on the table&mdash;publish the original scans, and the first transcriptions on a Github repository, seek out other researchers, contributors, transcribers, and source documents, then add them to the collection. This would be a fantstic exampe of networked research, publishable in its own right IMHO. This seems unlikely to happen now, oh well.</p>

    <div class="entry">
      
        <p>My time in Berlin was studded with generous hospitality, coupled by sufficient aimless wandering. It was just enough time to poke my head about and really get a feel for the city. I was lucky when I arrived it was cloudy, then rainy, and kept on that pattern for most of my days there. The final few days were sun-filled and glorious. If there were better weather I would have seriously believed I could move right in. Even the summer cold was enough to remind me, I am a spoiled desert creature of California. That being said, I can still imagine spending time there… just not forever, or maybe just not the winter.</p>
<p>Berlin is a locus for the surrounding European area, and Germany itself, not to mention a harbor for various migrants and ex-pats. Some years and mini-generations of migration and gentrification have welcomed, shunned, embraced, discarded, and churned the city through. It is such a large city that development is plentiful, but does leave many buildings untouched, quite a bit of existing infrastructure is just fine as is. That was the remarkable side for me, while not an extraordinarily tall city with sky-scrapers, there are very large swaths with 4-5 story buildings, built close together. This affords space for various uses, from housing to business, squats to co-working, markets to hackerspaces. The narrative today is represented best through the squats of yore, like Tacheles, now closed by building owners staking claim across the city to fuel business districts, housing enclaves, gentrifiers, and the many people generally coming through the city. The culture of these spaces, the mentality in various modes of collectivity, individuality and creativity remain. </p>
<p>The other theme of Berlin that cannot be over-stated is division, and return. Separation exists presently, and historically, at every layer of local life, as well as for the passing visitor like myself or any other tourist. It is a cycle of unification, (re-)purposing, and (re-)establishing divisions. The wall is demarkated, referenced, and displayed in various locations, in a sort of shattered array of a time still in living memory. Portions of the city were vacant, or used one way before, and for something else now. Old is re-used in new fashion, to benefit and detriment. </p>
<p>But enough of my urbanist suggestions. </p>
<p>Many thanks to the friends and hosts who showed me about. C-base is a space ship entrance, or a 90s scifi soundstage, or a seasoned, smoky, hacker center of international recognition and deep local value. I was lucky enough to get a tour downstairs, with a dose of lore, including that my hand-scan identified me as an alien entrant, while my crew member escorted me past various control panels in the dimly lit and hazy basement. On our way to dig out an esoteric french research book in which both c-base and sudo room are examined, we walked in to an on-going interview with the local public radio. Without skipping a beat, my host picked up a conversation in an adjacent room and swiftly ran through the boilerplate questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What&#39;s a hacker?</li>
<li>What&#39;s a hackerspace?</li>
<li>What do you do here?</li>
</ul>
<p>Flawless responses, a small move for public understanding.</p>
<p>If you are in Berlin, go to C-base, drink a mate soda, and hack the planet. Seriously. The crew-members-only basement is especially decked out—and if you can find a guide to give you a tour, it would be well worth it. The energy and thought put in over time is endearing. On the other hand, there are defiant elements that make things difficult for the space to be inclusive, despite its growth in membership and importance in global hacker and hackerspace communities. The budget is centralized, and decisions are made in a large group meeting, projects approved, and funds provided. The space is fairly do-ocratic, but there are some present functions that try on the membership. For instance, maintaining the space for public use and supporting events can wear on time and patience of members. Secondly, some take issue with pervasive cigarette smoke, necessitating a smoke-free space, AFRA. I did not get a chance to visit AFRA, but I will have to on my next return. They are fairly new and I hope they grow!</p>
<p>On the other hand, I did have a chance to stop by CCC Berlin. I found making contact with hackerspace folks in Berlin—and there are many, plus many in-between spaces—was a bit difficult. Folks generally treated spaces as clubs, where exclusivity is not just a default but sort of important. Folks were not unfriendly, it is simply that general access is not a priority, and a bit of skepticism is held. Attending events or getting in contact with individual members to show you around is a good way to get in and talk to folks. C-base is very accessible, but other than that, these spaces serve a narrow function of serving their members more than other things. </p>
<p>I had a chance to visit Potsdam, the decadant imperial city of various historical empires of the region, including San Soucci, a castle/mansion of sorts. The city was a good glimpse of the active construction and visions of the exotic and of concentrated state power. It was worth to witness such a thing, as modern (and American) imperialism is mainly dislocated, obscured, and now passive/pervasive.</p>
<p>Near the end of my stay, I attended an unanticipated event at C-base with talks from: <a href="http://vimeo.com/69582065" target="_blank">Andreas Lehner</a> of <a href="http://ccc.de/" target="_blank">CCC</a>, <a href="http://vimeo.com/69580427" target="_blank">Moritz Bratl</a> of <a href="https://www.torservers.net/" target="_blank">torservers.net</a> a non-profit that supports participation in the Tor project, and by activist <a href="http://vimeo.com/69570248" target="_blank">Jacob Applebaum</a>. I recommend watching it. The stand-out thread was the illegal PRISM program, the extent of US abuse of power including through surveillance, and asylum for Edward Snowden. You will be&mdash;should&mdash;be shocked and activated. In sum, there is more we can do to support projects like <a href="http://torproject.org/" target="_blank">Tor</a>, and protecting or saving time for people who need it most. If you are interested in teaching journalists and lawyers how to send encrypted messages, <a href="http://twitter.com/wrought" target="_blank">let me know</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, if you go to Berlin, I recommend getting around on bicycle. The public transport is very good, but moving via bicycle is a special pleasure by itself.</p>

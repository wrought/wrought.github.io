        <p>I support and celebrate operating systems based on Linux, well, because there are not many better options. ;) On the other hand, I also believe that community-supported tools and systems are worth our participation and involvement, because for what we all put in, we each, and collectively, get much more out. Simple as that.</p>
<p>Right now I run <a href="http://crunchbang.com/" target="_blank">CrunchBang</a>, a snappy, simplified, developer-conscious flavor of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian" target="_blank">Debian</a>, notably running the OpenBox window manager rather than something heftier like GNOME.</p>
<p>Since installing CrunchBang, I have come to appreciate its simplicity so much that I have wanted to continue using it, with all of my alterations, even as I upgrade my laptop. In this post, I outline a strategy to simplify management of your Linux system based on my experience so far with my operating system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bring your OS with you</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Pick an operating system. (For me at the moment, it&#39;s CrunchBang)<ol>
<li>Download an <code>.iso</code> (image) file</li>
<li>Use <code>unetbootin</code> or <code>dd</code> (<a href="http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/dd1.html" target="_blank">details</a>) to copy the image to a usb drive<ol>
<li>For using <code>dd</code>, find out the device names of your disks with <code>dmesg | grep sd</code>, which allows you to see details about drives and when they are connected.</li>
<li>Pick the right locations and fire <strong>[WARNING, MAY DESTROY STUFF]</strong>:<br> <code>dd if=/home/username/downloads/linux-foo-bar-0.1.iso of=/dev/sdBBB</code></li>
<li>Once finished, you can reboot, select the flash drive as the boot disk (usually change some settings in BIOS and then use some key like F12 to select boot device from a list)</li>
<li>Follow your OS&#39;s installation instructions.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Exact backup to empty drive with <code>dd</code><ol>
<li>Boot from a live OS (live disk, like CD or usb drive with linux on it)</li>
<li>Again, find the correct device names of disks first</li>
<li>This time copy from your computer&#39;s disk instead of an image to some backup file <strong>[WARNING, MAY DESTROY STUFF]</strong>:<br> <code>dd if=/dev/sdAAA of=/dev/sdBBB</code></li>
<li>To recover a <em>borked</em> system, you can always copy in the other direction to restore <strong>[WARNING, MAY DESTROY STUFF]</strong>:<br> <code>dd if=/dev/sdBBB of=/dev/sdAAA</code></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Backup with <code>horcrux</code> on top of <code>duplicity</code> (<a href="http://chrispoole.com/project/horcrux/" target="_blank">details</a>)<ol>
<li>This is for more magic, like multiple restoration points, partial backups, and most importantly, backing up to multiple locations in case of multiple failures</li>
<li><code>horcrux</code> is pretty much a <code>bash</code> script for <code>duplicity</code>, so read it and <code>man duplicity</code>!</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Store <em>special</em> files with <code>tomb</code> (<a href="https://www.dyne.org/software/tomb/" target="_blank">details</a>)<ol>
<li>A fun and tiny way to bury bits on your disk, excellent alternative to full-disk encryption schemes</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Migrate to new devices with <code>dd</code> and <code>lvm</code><ol>
<li>When it&#39;s time to upgrade or replace your computer, you can carry everything with you. There is only one important question:<ol>
<li>Is the destination hard drive bigger or smaller than my current one?<ol>
<li>Either way you will have to resize the <em>physical volume</em> and <em>logical volumes</em> in question, but if the destination drive is bigger, than you can copy now and resize later ;)<ol>
<li>Resizing un-encrypted partitions can be as easy as running <code>gparted</code>, <code>parted</code>, <code>fdisk</code>, or simply with <code>lvm</code> commands</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>However, encrypted partitions are not as easy to manage. See notes below for resizing encrypted partitions:</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Pro-tip:</em> Check the progress of <code>dd</code> with <code>sudo kill -USR1 `pidof dd` </code></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Enlarging LUKS Encryption over LVM</h3>
<p>These days, it‘s easy to implement full-disk encryption at the time of your operating system’s installation. Further, it&#39;s usually recommended to use LVM to manage your disks, even on a personal computer. <code>lvm</code> creates a layer of abstraction on top of typical partitions, which can make some forms of disk management much easier or less risky. If you installed a recent distribution of linux based on Debian, and installed fill-disk encryption it is likely you are using LUKS over LVM. </p>
<p>For debian-based systems, this guide called <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ResizeEncryptedPartitions" target="_blank">Resize Encrypted Partitions</a> should be close to what you need, with some noteworthy updates:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Step 1.</strong> When creating a new partition “next to and to the left of (after) your crypt”, don&#39;t let this language confuse you. You want the encrypted partition to have a new partition immediately following it so that you may use <code>fdisk</code> to overwrite this new partition by expanding the encrypted partition over the new partition. This should help make more sense of the situation. It&#39;s likely that you have <code>/dev/sda1</code> with <code>/boot</code> on it and <code>/dev/sda2</code> as an extended partition that contains your encrypted partition (something like <code>/dev/sda5</code> maybe, depending on how many partitions you made at installation and later with LVM). This is why it is likely that creating another Linux partition inside of the <code>/dev/sda2</code> extended partition would likely use the name <code>/dev/sda6</code> as the instructions note. If you view this in <code>gparted</code> you would see <code>/dev/sda2</code> wrapped around the encrypted <code>/dev/sda5</code> as well as around the following new partition <code>/dev/sda6</code>, ending the wrapper.</li>
<li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Don&#39;t bother with <code>/dev/urandom</code> it takes forever, just use <code>/dev/zero</code> or if you prefer, you can use <code>shred</code> instead of <code>dd</code> with the <code>--iterations</code> flag as such: <code>sudo shred --iterations=1 /dev/sda6</code></li>
<li><strong>Step 3.</strong> This is a very confusing reference. You are instructed to use <code>fdisk</code> in the same process as it is used for shrinking partitions in the instructions preceeding these (above). However, there are superfluous warnings, commands, and instructions that make it difficult to implement here. The important concept to note, in my opinion, is simply that you are using fdisk to expand your encrypted partition over the new, adjacent partition. This means you should use <code>fdisk /dev/sda</code> to <code>d</code> delete partitions <code>6</code>, <code>5</code> and <code>2</code>, then <code>n</code> re-create them as partitions <code>2</code> (<code>e</code> expanded) and <code>5</code> (<code>l</code> logical) such that (by default) <code>/dev/sda5</code> expands over the blocks previously partitioned for <code>/dev/sda6</code>. Check with <code>p</code> and when you are satisfied, <code>w</code> write to the disk.</li>
<li>After <strong>Step 8.</strong> If you are troubleshooting the process, to deactivate your LVM, use <code>sudo vgchange -an</code></li>
<li><strong>Step 11.</strong> Repeat as necessary for each <em>logical volume</em> you wish to resize (e.g. <code>root</code>, <code>swap</code>, and <code>home</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Step 12.</strong> You won&#39;t be able to resize the filesystem for swap. If you do resize a swap volume, when you reboot and complete the resizing successfully, simply use <code>mkswap</code> appropriately such as:<br> <code>sudo swapoff</code><br> <code>sudo mkswap /dev/crypt1/swap_1</code><br> <code>sudo swapon</code></li>
</ol>
<h2>The Future</h2>
<p>Maybe in the future I will switch to ArchLinux to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_release/" target="_blank">avoid major upgrade headaches</a>, get on board with the new future-of-linux features, and benefit from a great community with lots of documentation..</p>
<p>In fact, I&#39;m downloading Arch right now… ;)</p>

        <blockquote>
<p>“Food must be shared.” &mdash; <a href="https://kesselberg.info" target="_blank">Kesselberg</a> (Community)</p>
<p>“Be excellent to each other.” &mdash; <a href="https://noisebridge.net" target="_blank">Noisebridge</a> (Hackerspace)</p>
<p>“Don&#39;t be evil.” &mdash; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google" target="_blank">Google</a> (Company)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How do we socially organize? How do we share our most basic principles, morals, values? What does it mean when we simplify, when we search for or even implement essentialized notions as the baseline for a community&#39;s standards?</p>
<p>Three examples have come to mind of late and instigate these questions for me. I do not have the answers, but it creates an alluring pursuit.</p>
<h2>Kesselberg (Berlin)</h2>
<p>First, Kesselberg is an unrestricted, autonomous, intentional community outside of Berlin, Germany. The community has quite a strong core who have been living in their discrete location for some time. On the other hand, the place is truly open to anyone who wants to come there, and thus some people come who are less intentional about their stay with respect to the others, but are allowed nonetheless. A dynamic exists between these groups, and I cannot say where it stands at the moment, though I am attempting to investige further. Ultimately, there is only one rule. If you have food, you need to share it. This is a clever concept, focusing on commoning a basic human need and resource, as well as identifying a mode for social exchange around the hearth, bowl, hand, fire, etc. Its implications prove interesting at the very least.</p>
<h2>Noisebridge (San Francisco)</h2>
<p>Another community, Noisebridge, in the mission district of San Francisco, also has just one rule. Quoting Keanu Reeves in <strong>Bill and Ted&#39;s Excellent Adventure</strong>. Reeves plays a Southern Californian teenager who travels in time in order to learn history, finish his final project for his history class,  and graduate from high school. If he fails, in the future, he won&#39;t later co-create a peaceful society guided by the music and philosophy of his excellent rock-and-roll band. </p>
<p>Travelling to this future society, Reeve&#39;s character learns from their leaders that his future self has taught the planet about world peace. He is prompted to share some wisdom. He takes a moment, gets all poetic on us, and states, “Be excellent to each other.” Nothing more appropriate for culture-jamming hackers to adopt as their basic and altruistic motto for moral guidance.</p>
<p>However, “Be excellent to each other” is not perfect. In the Noisebridge community, there has been much ambiguity around this notion and phrasing. Further, to emphasize being excellent has suggested to some that therefore some attitude, behaviors, and practices are <strong>“un-excellent”</strong> and should therefore be identified, prevented, or otherwise opposed in the spirit of being “excellent” instead. On the other hand, the hacker community has memetically spread this rule around the world where it has a place and application in many other communities. It is certainly imperfect, but it has legs, which is worth a ponder…</p>
<h2>Google</h2>
<p>Finally, there is one dangerously simplistic phrase, for which there is certainly ample debate already. Google‘s “Don’t be evil” has the opposite <em>problem</em> as being “excellent” has for Noisebridge. Why state this principle in the negative? Why should being “evil” be avoided? We shouldn&#39;t we “be good” or some similar positive equivalent? In some way, we see the practice of this essential concept at work as Google grows in its wealth and power. Will Google become evil? Is Google evil in some ways already? What is evil? What are the good things that Google does? Can they be compared to the evil, or is evil absolute and represent a fundamental failure?</p>
<h2>In sum…</h2>
<p>To me, I am most impressed by Kesselberg‘s statement because (unlike the other two above), it has a clear but unviable opposite. To not share one’s food is unambiguous. In some way keeping, food to one‘s self (in most cases) would lean toward self-interest and away from commons-building. If the priority of the community is to share one’s food if one has food, then greater than self-evidence, this community has a reasonable request for which the opposite can be easily understood, as it is fairly undebatable (at least in construction). I think this may be an indicator of what can make a very valuable basis of a moral system.</p>
<p>Additionally, Kesselberg‘s food sharing notion converges on one of a person’s most basic needs, functions, and elements of day-to-day life. The sharing of food creates the possibility and potential for further interaction and engagement. It is such sharing that brings people together, where other aspects of culture may emerge and flourish. Time to listen, to understand, to express, be creative, to relax, and to grow, bonding with others.</p>
<h2>In Math…</h2>
<p>In the practice of mathematics, an informal (non-binding) principle is the concept of <strong>elegance</strong>. Simply put, elegance emphasizes (even prioritizes) simplicity. If something can be said as one shorter statement, rather than two, then do it! It&#39;s of course not universal, and there are lots of counter examples, as you might imagine. Further, elegance may very well be anthropocentric; do the context and constraints of being a human predispose or bias us away from complexity in our models? I believe this certainly can be the case, and therefore we should be aware of such bias.</p>
<p>From a logical stand-point, non-trivial but minimal systems that demonstrate elegance can be illustrative, powerful (theoretically), and even practical. For instance, consider in propositional logic, the functionally complete formal system constructed from a single operator: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_NAND" target="_blank">Nand or “not and”</a>. This system allows the construction of all the commonly sensical equivalents of logic (‘and’, ‘or’, ‘implies’, ‘not’, etc) in a more abstract way (complex in length, simple in basis). On top of it all, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAND_logic" target="_blank">logical Nand</a> is the operation implemented in the Nand gate, the tool by which computational machines may function!</p>
<p>These simple rules or statements used by the communities listed above make me think about such mathematical elegance, in a heuristical and poetic sense.</p>
<p>&lt;/end&gt;</p>

        <p>Just met up with Hayley from <a href="http://villagecraft.org/" target="_blank">Villagecraft.org</a> at sudo room. Got some updates about the progress of their project, including some exciting patterns from their user base and general solidarity across creative/learning community life!</p>
<p>Zero<sup>th</sup>, they&#39;re hosting a Dinner Party this Thursday June 12th at 6pm, register on villagecraft itself to join.</p>
<p>First, they&#39;re going <em>open source</em>, which means they&#39;ll finally be publishing their source code online, opening up the prospect of review, contribution, and creativity with the very platform that runs the villagecraft website. They support a community of hosts and attendees sharing knowledge at workshop-style events in the east bay area. This is certainly a project <a href="https://lists.sudoroom.org/" target="_blank">sudoers</a> will be interested in examining more closely.</p>
<p>Second, they have a <strong>plan</strong> ;). Meaning, they&#39;ve got a list of features <em>and</em> a list of bugs that they plan to get through to truly improve the villagecraft experience. Hayley spends a lot of time in the field, doing manual coordination, listening, and problem-solving. The results of her lessons she shares back to the rest of the team, most of whom write the bulk of the villagecraft software.</p>
<p>Third, and finally, the future is uncertain! New folks are getting on board to write software, and the organic user community is growing in interesting and strange ways (more on that below). There are open questions, big opportunities, and a clear need to grow wider (and not necessarily spend too much time going so deep). Hayley reached out on this particular accord, hoping to include more participation from hackerspace, techie, hardware/software/wetware communities. It seems to me the opportunity to cross sudo room‘s events and villagecraft’s community platform is certainly real, and very exciting.</p>
<p>As for these user patterns. Two things Hayley shared are:<br>1. The villagecraft user base is growing inter-connected as an organic community.<br>2. Some of their users take several workshops across domains, rather than focus on individual domains.</p>
<p>These patterns seem to imply that the time to widen and grow the community is nigh. Further, the intuitive notion that users will pursue learning experiences based on the domain-specificity of their interests may very well be untrue thusfar!</p>
<p>Lastly, Hayley, Jeremy, and I shared some of our interests and experiences working in creative communities, using consensus, using safe space, positioning do-ocracy over bureaucracy, celebrating good-faith collaboration, and confronting bad-faith participants. As a result of our discussion, looks like I&#39;ll be hosting a workshop on <a href="http://villagecraft.org/w/3c71912c-starting-a-hackerspace" target="_blank">Starting a Hackerspace</a>, based on the <a href="https://sudoroom.org/" target="_blank">sudo room</a> experience, conversations with folks starting hackerspaces locally as well as remotely, and my recent post on an off-the-cuff protocol: <a href="http://existenceproof.net/zero-to-hackerspace-in-eight-steps/">8 steps to start a hackerspace</a>. Additionally, Jeremy will be hosting one on <em>Consensus Process</em>, which we all agreed is much needed and even long-overdue.</p>
<p>Very exciting ;).</p>

        <p>I have begun to discuss with some local folks about a nascent hackerspace in the east bay area. More details on that forthcoming. Reviewing some of our messages about this, I found an interesting little ditty. I wrote it in a stream of consciousness after an in-person meeting to try to quickly simplify my own mental model of starting a hackerspace.</p>
<h2>Eight Steps to Hackerspace</h2>
<p>The overall process I find successful for hackerspaces is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open up a dialog by meeting regularly, hosting an email list (maybe also a website, wiki, and irc channel).</li>
<li>Invite potential members/participants and stakeholders, challenge yourself to be accessible to a wider community, strive for equity and parity.</li>
<li>Seek to remain transparent, mutually accountable, and to build stakeholdership and ownership of new members/participants.</li>
<li>Set an agenda for each meeting beforehand. Give each item a time limit, adjusting as necessary. Designate a facilitator and note-taker, rotating as necessary (even mid-meeting). Always post the notes afterwards (on email list, wiki, etc). Switch roles, trade off and build comfort, skill, experience collaborating together.</li>
<li>Share your individual visions. Collaborate to form a shared vision, based on consent. Write it down. Improve it.</li>
<li>Collectively determine the goals that will allow you to accomplish concrete steps toward that shared vision.</li>
<li>Value safe space <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe-space" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe-space</a></li>
<li>Hack the planet.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>Oddly enough, this has little to do with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic/" target="_blank">hacking</a> per se! It has more to do with ensuring that your community is best able to express itself in an air of empathy, excitement, and collaboration. It is very easy to close up, to act more like a club, or to lose track of how to remain open, accessible, and fair. It is difficult, however, to remain diligent, awake, and improve as you grow and create your hackerspace. Ultimately, the details of what <em>kind</em> of hacking you do, and what sort of <em>arrangement</em> you make of your space will be important, but not nearly as important as dreaming, together, along with your community, and ensuring that you share portions of these dreams, sufficient to know what directions to go.</p>

        <p>While in town for <a href="http://wikiconferenceusa.org/" target="_blank">WikiConference USA</a> I had the pleasure of spending a bit of extra time in New York City. Some kind souls were generous enough to spend their time with me, showing their spaces, answering questions, and generally mutually sharing our experiences. One such group who opened their doors and obliged an extended conversation is <a href="http://abcnorio.org/" target="_blank">ABC No Rio</a>.</p>
<p>I stopped by the space previously, but no one was around, so I glanced at various (past and present) event postings on flyers and posters around the doors, though I couldn&#39;t make it to any I saw. However, I <em>was</em> able to step inside once I had a chance to schedule a conversation with two long-term volunteers of the space, who also are board members for the 501(c)3 non-profit organization that supports it. This organization exists primarily to keep ABC No Rio&#39;s physical location in community control, coordinate fund-raising for improvements (see notes about <a href="#rebuild">re-build</a> below), and to otherwise support the continued existence of the community. Otherwise, all the function of the space itself is performed by individual volunteers through the various sub-collectives of ABC No Rio, and one non-profit tenant of the building.</p>
<p>Genuinely, ABC is a commons, though one that has seen fluctuating usage and emphases over the years. A group and place that has remained open for 30 years, spanning not only societal eras, but eras all their own. Currently, there are the following collectives in the space:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual Arts<ul>
<li>Run gallery space at entrance</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Music Performances (esp. punk)<ul>
<li>Double gallery as music venue</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Free jazz / improv<ul>
<li>Also use gallery space for performances</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Zine library<ul>
<li>Upstairs half floor</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dark Room<ul>
<li>Upstairs half floor</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Screenprinting<ul>
<li>Upstairs half floor</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Computer Lab</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus one partner organization leasing space in the basement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time&#39;s Up (bike workshop)</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="rebuild"></a></p>
<h3>Rebuild</h3>
<p>ABC No Rio owns its current building on Rivington Street in the Lower East Side. It was never in perfect condition, and though it remains functional and accessible, today more than ever it needs attention. Luckily, they are now closer than ever to raising the total ~$7 million to create a brand new building, with a much improved design.

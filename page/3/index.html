        <p>Got some sleep in, not as much as I would have liked, but what can I expect having accidentally chosen ‘’the worst seat on the bus‘’ with no leg-room, haha?</p>
<p>On the other hand this bus, a new one for the agency providing me service, is more akin to an airplane in some senses. These little screens at each seat play movies, music, games, some hilarious Czech student documentaries (very odd), and six episodes of one television show: ‘’Friends‘’ ^.^ heh.</p>
<p>There was advertisement of wifi on the bus, but I was told it would only work in the Czech Republic&mdash;now that we are here, I am still waiting, with no signal from the bus… and no signal from the terminal. Hopefully bus 167 to Berlin will have wifi enabled ;).</p>
<p>Lausanne was a great time, many thanks to the folks at FixMe like Jean-Baptiste and especially Malloc, who carted me out to the countryside for a great walk through some Swiss farms and ultimately asking his girlfriend if I can crash at her house in a small village (~200 persons) outside of town. The next day he got me back to Fixme in Lausanne, we shared an excellent good fondue in the old part of town, hacked a bit on a <a href="http://ba.chgrp.org/" target="_blank">BACH</a> port of <a href="http://hackerspaces.ch" target="_blank">hackerspaces.ch</a> before I left! I hope to return, especially now knowing that the Swiss hackerspaces are learning to coordinate, starting simple through <a href="http://hackerspaces.ch/" target="_blank">hackerspaces.ch</a> (started by #fixme) as well as through a <a href="http://ccc-ch.ch/" target="_blank">CCC Switzerland</a> group. Perhaps in two years for the next #OAI8? Fixme members are more than welcome to visit the bay area&mdash;hit me up ;).</p>
<p><a href="http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/Fixme" target="_blank">Fixme</a> has an odd problem for hackerspaces. Despite being open for 3 years now and following the <a href="">hackerspace patterns</a>, the space is often closed and not used enough! They have enough full-member income to stabilize rent, even with student discounts for that tier and a second tier of membership that is cheaper. Part of the problem, they think, is that not enough folks have access. This was a bit odd to me, and upon further inquisition, it turns out a member poll they thought had attested to a lack of interest in keys was quite the opposite&mdash;people want them (glad I asked)!</p>
<p>In the meantime, they already set up a system for giving keys to folks who host events in the space, like meetups, as a way to encourage use and distribute access. Further, they are using a trust network of their membership to distribute additional keys (members get 3 keys and give 2 to people they trust). Since the keys use RFID, they can revoke access if necessary. My theory is: the ability to revoke is more useful than revoking itself. </p>
<p>So far, both PTL and Fixme are entirely men, the former has women stop by sometimes during their Tuesday dinner event, and the latter only when girlfriends of members attend (though there is one person who has been in more than a couple times). My conversations with members of both spaces indicate they think they would benefit from having different kinds of folks involved, it is just unclear how&mdash;and to me, the seeming lack of a champion. For instance, a girlfriend of one of the Fixme members drew their logo, which is a pretty cool androgynous cyborg. </p>
<p>The question is perhaps, what do folks who have already made touch points with these spaces want? How can the space be welcoming and open to their needs, interests, and beneficial additions to overall visions?</p>

        <p>The Geneva airport is not poorly designed, works well enough to get through from plane to train into the city. Not enough maps though, had to resort to the phone directions. </p>
<p>The mountainscape was an impressive view, I hope to take it all in later. Ah, the humidity is wonderful, overcast but muggy, what a pleasure!</p>
<p>Train tunnel graffiti is a familiar and welcome sight. More thoughts later, not sure when exactly is my stop.</p>

        <p>I &lt;3 New York city. Yes, in the cheesiest possible way because I do not live there and if I did I would probably complain (an East Coast sort of thing I can understand, but with which I must strain to emphathize). It is the mark of a new New Yorker that the irks and annoyances of a rub-you-the-wrong way type of town float up to the top of your head and bubble out&mdash;least-expected&mdash;at earliest invonvenience, like what has been happening with my California transplant cousin Debbie! No need to worry, the kids are good, the neighborhood is excellent, and despite all the complexities of maximal urban density, Debbie and Marc&#39;s family is doing well, and they have <em>much</em> for which to be proud. Lucas is moving out to San Francisco this fall for school, I will see them again in August&mdash;a chance to ‘’chill out‘’ ;). </p>
<p>I get on quite well with the NY humidity, despite being a desert creature used to high and dry temperatures. I love that sweating is universal and mandatory, no ifs, ands, or buts about it, we all have to stink. But more than the weather, its the hubbub and density that prevail, lucky me only around for the bustle and none of the hussle. Quick transport, heavy on the walking, low ceilings, narrow hallways, old rickety elevators, cute little everythings, function stacking, squeezing out every ounce of space&mdash;oh, efficiency never felt so good. Cities, you have a lot to learn, it should be way easier to repurpose all these ideas and all this praxis. Perhaps such is the essence of politics, and the friction of translation. </p>
<p>The trip to and fro Newark International Airport evoked a poem:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Newark Intl &larr;&rarr; Penn Station</strong></p>
<p>A wild green and rusty old feel<br>strewn among rubble, stones, and rivulets<br>pockmarks of broken windows high on old warehouses<br>marshes and an impossible density of reeds</p>
<p>prisoners hang across the tracks<br>in a barbwire yard<br>they play basketball<br>and some just move about, slowly</p>
<p>we never see this green in the citier parts<br>but damn what a number of bricks<br>they make it easy to imagine<br>the hands it took to lay</p>
<p>a woman darts across the platform at secaucus<br>just before her, a man slipped in the train<br>from his wake, she pulls the doors open<br>barely enough to squeeze in, smiling</p>
<p>on my train<br>seated commuters return home<br>it reminds me of California trains<br>San Jose<br>San Juaquin<br>but did I mention the green? and old too…</p>
</blockquote>


<p>In an earnest effort at earliness, I showed up to the terminal 3 comfortable hours before flight time. All possible crises averted, yet, as 5:00pm approached, we already hit a number of unanticipated delays. While in New York earlier in the day, I saw an SUV pull up the street, approaching me, and thinking perhaps this driver was seeking a word, I peered into their windows, and no sooner than she came to a rest did the rear passenger door open to a young girl… expressing her upset stomach on the street. I had been wondering why the girl in the front seat was giving herself such an intense face-palm. Well little did I know this would become a theme&mdash;the plane that arrived for us to go to Geneva had what was apparently a chaotic fit of human oral excrement&mdash;to a degree requiring more than their initial cleaning attempts, but an actual carpet replacement. And finally, with our flight just stablizing in air, I see a young boy with a petrified look, shirtless, speckled with his upchuck swifted by his father to a rear restroom.</p>
<p>I actually love these humanly things very much, and am happy to see so much life exposed and unfolding. We have nothing to be ashamed of, and I wish all these sick children the best&mdash;despite arriving late for my conference on Wednesday ^.^</p>

        <p>Writing this on a plane, coasting over the US toward Newark, NJ where I will stay for the evening, catching a connection to Geneva tomorrow morning. Laying it all bare here (that is right folks&mdash;all honesty!), I missed my connecting flight because I showed up (on time) to Oakland Airport (OAK) rather than San Francisco (SFO). &gt;.&lt;</p>
<p>It took me all until I reached the terminals to realize there was no United airline and /no/ flight waiting for me in Oakland. </p>
<p>Luckily, I doubled-back on BART all the way to SFO, which took about 1 hour and 45 minutes, in time to at least catch a flight out to the east coast, where I can pick an early flight in the morning to Switzerland.</p>
<p>All is well that ends well right? There was no charge and the adventure indeed has begun.</p>

        <p>Trying my first post :D</p>
<p><a href="http://getplican.com" target="_blank">Pelican</a> turned out to be a bit of a pain in the ass. No holds barred here, startup was fairly annoying and would probably be much harder for folks /completely/ unfamiliar with python applications.</p>
<p>I stepped into the <a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.2/getting_started.html#installing-pelican" target="_blank">quick-start walkthrough</a>, borrowed a few components from pelicanconf.py configuration files on the web, checked out available <a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes" target="_blank">pelican-themes</a>, and settled on a slight remix of <a href="http://github.com/shreeshga/just-read-theme.git" target="_blank">Just-Read</a> used on <a href="http://www.chippedprism.com/" target="_blank">chippedprism</a> (at least to start).</p>
<p>So why go through with it?</p>
<p>I have a several goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>Try to write more HTML5</li>
<li>Reap benefits &amp; low overhead of static content sites</li>
<li>Adopt a community-used tool for saving time/energy and using handy features</li>
<li>Strengthen my markdown skills</li>
<li>Leverage VIM more often for writing long-form text</li>
</ol>

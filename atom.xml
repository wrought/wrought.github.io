    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have found theories for social movements, especially civil rights, anti-war, and even protest generally, to be wholly insufficient to capture substantial aspects of our current struggle for openness.</p>
<p>Openness is not merely some product of technology, nor is it some new technology itself. Openness affords public good akin to notions of democracy. Both constitute negotiations of appropriate action, and fairness. We have seen various communities organize in support of openness, and it is about time we leverage this network structure&mdash;in fact there is no such luxury to wait:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Exponential Growth</strong> - The struggle for openness is directly in opposition to the desires of many incumbent institutions and firms, especially those who benefit through money and power/control. There is no time to grow linearly, even by a factor greater than one. For every interval, we need to grow at a greater rate than the previous interval. Next year, we cannot merely double, but rather, we must outpace ourselves from the previous year and prepare to grow even faster the next. This implies:<ul>
<li>Time is completely of the essence and we should be wary of delay and derailment strategies that wear us down.</li>
<li>We must be extremely clever and use all available tools to bend any of our linear growth into exponential ones such as via media that afford ease of coordination, automation and amplification, as well as both traditional and experimental funding mechanisms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Diversity of Tactics</strong> - If the first principle can be illustrated by a steep, exponential curve, then this second can be thought of through the <em>long tail</em>, the log, or exponential inverse. If we consolidate efforts and rally behind unified fronts, we can produce great results, akin to the beginning “head” component of a log distribution. However, there is substantial value in niche approaches and opportunities, the many small areas where openness can be adopted, often in unique or atypical ways. The sum of the long tail very well may be equivalent in size to the head of the curve.<ul>
<li>Consolidation can be advantageous, but exclusively it is antithetical to openness itself. It cannot be the only option.</li>
<li>Perhaps even greater than doubling impact, a diversity of tactics supports positive feedback, a range of ideas and materials that can be fed into other open initiatives in fashions we cannot predict.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Peer-to-Peer Structure</strong> - Of the many lessons learned from legacy institutions that employ closed and proprietary systems, among them is that concentration of power breeds unfairness and injustice. This lesson must be intuited for openness to succeed. Not only the concession, but the active pursuit of peer-oriented models is the only viable alternative to trading one set of regimes for another, or merely squishing regimes into a slightly smaller, but still dominant position.<ul>
<li>Thus we must address hierarchy at every level and work toward deconstructing it, even if it will take time.</li>
<li>We must also commit to resolving conflicts and disputes swiftly through solidarity since divided we currently are conquered.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<ol>
<li><em><a href="http://kopimism.org/" target="_blank">Open Access Manifesto</a></em> - Simply put, Aaron was right. This is a moral issue. We have an imperative to reject the rules, and abide by them, however we see fit, in the aim to set information free.</li>
<li><em>Public Policy</em> - It is not the sole struggle of the Openness movement to see results from the political process. All movements for social change today must confront the deep and crippling corruption of the democratic process and state accountability in a global context. We must pursue this avenue, it is not fruitless, but we also cannot lose sight of the need for our movement to operate at every level.</li>
<li><em>Infrastructure</em> - Every bit counts. When we have the opportunity, or the privilege, we must invest in building lasting, or temporary, infrastructure to support openness. This means: open a hackerspace, donate to good causes, find ways to hack livelihood for yourselves and others to do things in the open, engage in public discourse, engage in politics at the local level up, make art and express yourself creatively in ways that promote openness, buy land, buy businesses, buy banks&mdash;<em>set it all free!</em></li>
</ol>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It is true much of the journey requires travel, logistics, negotiation of new landscapes, but the wandering can feel quite good. I flew in to South London at Gatwick, made the mistake of traveling farthest from my destination, so I took a long train through london, then a connection to King‘s Cross station to Cambridge. A friend set me up for the night at his new flat, and in the morning I walked just a few blocks to the Cambridge PLOS office. It wasn’t long in the UK until I began to take issue with the absurdity of placeness here. Every tiny street has its own name, and every little building. Often place names differ completely from address, and often addresses become complex since streets need not follow conventions like odds on one side, evens on the other. And good luck finding a street sign to know where you are. It is a comical, ironical place, but I do appreciate that for the most part, places are built to human dimensions, and confusion, more than anything, stems from history, the beaten path as it were. </p>
<p>In cambridge I met some of the members of Makespace, a new hackerspace with great institutional support and a fantastic location provided through a relationship with King&#39;s College. In just a few months, the members built up quite a bit of infrastructure, providing a full toolshop including laser cutters (one in service, the other large but out of commission at the moment), 3D printer, and a store room full of all the necessary nicnacs. A clever little move was to use clear bins for member ephemera on a member shelf in the hallway—keeping things quite orderly, but transparent to get a clue onthe types of materials other members are tinkering with at the moment. The general governance of the group is odd—there are three founders who act as directors and make the necessary decisions for the space, including allocation of funds. There is some layer of trust in which members, especially those who had been around for some time, were relied upon more heavily to work things out and improve the functioning of the space. There are general discussions on the email list, and general meetings, to work out different points of view, etc. There are more than a handful systems in place to manage the space, including a sort of “training the trainer” approach that requires a designated party to train you on using specific equipment before you can take it on yourself. This is for safety, and for the preservation of the equipment. </p>
<p>I had two particularly fruitfull exchanges with folks at Makespace. First, I was barely able to make it in, save posting on a meetup event that happened to be advertised for the night I was in town. The space is not open to the public generally, only for events and member-sponsored guests. this was taken to the extreme since leaving the space required a key, or breaking the glass on an emergency exit button. When my original tour guide and host had to leave, I asked to stick around to coordinate with my local friend to crash that night, and had to be “transferred” to another member to stick around. Lucky enough, they were both very welcoming, so it wasn‘t too much trouble. On the other hand, this is yet another case I’ve found of serving member needs with little infrastructure to support public access.</p>
<p>Second, I spoke with Rachel Raynes, artist in residence with the Raspberry Pi Foundation. She makes cool exploratory things with raspi&#39;s and represents their creative side at various events and conferences, etc. She was very supportive of a bay area <a href="http://ba.chgrp.org/#outsiders" target="_blank">hacker-in-residence</a> idea, we agreed similar such opportunities are absolutely necessary both on the side of creative projects and on the side of funding out-of-the-box thinkers. Through our discussion I also got to hear of an on-going thread at makespace about how to provide access and membership. On the one hand, some contend the institutional model of garnering donations from organizations. On the other hand is the accrual of income from membership dues. the discussion on hand at the moment concerns rates, and level of access, depending on the ability to pay the membership fee. For instance, there seems to be sympathy for financial hardship, but on the other, not necessarily the same perspective for students or folks who would claim they are unable to contribute as much, generally. It is a <a href="http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/Design_Patterns" target="_blank">hacker pattern</a> to offer a full and “starving hacker” rate. Of course, patterns are not rules at all, and our different approaches to this problem fit different contexts and help inform our overall strategies. Our diversity is not only a boon, but integral.</p>
<p>Our approach at sudo room is to both provide public access as an organizational goal, and to allow for sliding-scale contributions (or hopefully non-monetary using a fair system). This addresses two complexities:</p>
<ol>
<li>How do we approach access to resources for communities that do not have or choose to exercise the privilege to enter such spaces, especially those who would very much benefit from the community and the infrastructure itself?</li>
<li>How do we make governance of the organization democratic, in a sense that all folks who use the space can have a serious voice in its functioning?</li>
</ol>
<p>I think our solution is incomplete, but am very proud of the attempted approach. It is now our responsibility to improve it and accomplish the sort of diversity of perspective, and stakholdership, that we know is necessary and fruitful overall.</p>
<p>When I made it to London, I eventually wound up at the London Hackspace, a hackerspace in Hackney. I was surprised the pun was not pervasive, but pleased enough with various other puns in the space ;). </p>
<p>First of all, this is their new location as of some time this year (I believe the spring?), and it is HUGE. If there is anyone in the UK area looking to hold some hacker event, I say lobby the London Hackspace. The entrance is in the back through a large parking lot (confusing since the whole front of the building is on Hackney street). The ground floor has a quiet room, an electronics work bench, a lounge, a recording studio, a restroom with shower, a classroom, and general hacking space. Downstairs has the biohacking space (a closet, much bigger than the former storage closet they used before—people can actually sit or stand at benches here), a woodshop, a metal shop, shelves of various materials, an open workshop area, a bicycle repair stand, and boxes of various things still unpacked from the move. </p>
<p>Chatting with a few members, I came to understand the basic governance and the history of the space. They were in a much more cramped location before, and all were glad to have moved to this new location in the same general area. Things are doocratic, encouraging folks to work stuff out on their own, and to organize together to get things they want and see things change as needed. There is a board of elected folks, with a pattern to change 3 members every year, totalling 9, and cycling at a rate of 3 years—though there is no hard and fast rule not to be re-elected for many terms anyway. This group makes financial decisions, signs necessary contracts, and resolves disputes. When they had more money in the small space, they would allocate funds to tools and projects, but now they are strapped with rent for their grand space and encourage members to find interest amongst some others, and pool some money together to buy whatever it is they need. Often things are donated, or found cheaply, so this is not too bad. </p>
<p>Over the weekend in London, I went to two hackathons, especially to meet up with <a href="http://twitter.com/evo_mri" target="_blank">Daniel Mietchen</a> to collaborate on extending a Commons media importer to upload <a href="http://github.com/wrought/open-access-media-importer" target="_blank">Open Access videos to Youtube</a>. We got a lot of work in, and started a few other good threads, but the project is not yet finished ;). The first event was <a href="http://hack4ac.com/" target="_blank">#hack4ac</a>, where participants tried to demonstrate the power and utility of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org" target="_blank">CC-BY license</a>. The next was a medical-themed event put on by BMJ at the Hub Westminster. I was very pleased with the venue, and am considering using it in the future for other events. The projects were very excellent at both events, my personal favorite the <a href="http://twitter.com/oa_button" target="_blank">OA Button</a>.</p>
<p>Before leaving, I dipped my toe in Oxford, dropping in on some Digital Humanities workshops. It was intresting to see various perspectives on digital culture and opportunities from this group. One attendee quite eloquently shared, “The only future for humanities is digital.” There is no alternative, there are many questions and much uncertainty, but the future for the humanities will not remain in analog formats. I also got a chance to talk to a PhD student who researches “Questionnaires,” surprisingly old documents, especially used by enlightenment philosophers and public intellectuals to find out about things beyond their knowledge, such as life in the “New World.” It was a rather perplexing exchange. This researcher found a series of unpublished questionnaires. There is such a great opportunity for her to reach out and find swaths of similar documents, and connect to peer researchers. However, the fixation of mining out this academic gold of unpublished source work outweighs the opportunity to collaborate in the open. This is the precise challenge of humanities work. How does one overcome incentives as strong as career fodder? Ultimately, I left my suggestion on the table&mdash;publish the original scans, and the first transcriptions on a Github repository, seek out other researchers, contributors, transcribers, and source documents, then add them to the collection. This would be a fantstic exampe of networked research, publishable in its own right IMHO. This seems unlikely to happen now, oh well.</p>

    <updated>2013-10-30T08:40:58.000Z</updated>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My time in Berlin was studded with generous hospitality, coupled by sufficient aimless wandering. It was just enough time to poke my head about and really get a feel for the city. I was lucky when I arrived it was cloudy, then rainy, and kept on that pattern for most of my days there. The final few days were sun-filled and glorious. If there were better weather I would have seriously believed I could move right in. Even the summer cold was enough to remind me, I am a spoiled desert creature of California. That being said, I can still imagine spending time there… just not forever, or maybe just not the winter.</p>
<p>Berlin is a locus for the surrounding European area, and Germany itself, not to mention a harbor for various migrants and ex-pats. Some years and mini-generations of migration and gentrification have welcomed, shunned, embraced, discarded, and churned the city through. It is such a large city that development is plentiful, but does leave many buildings untouched, quite a bit of existing infrastructure is just fine as is. That was the remarkable side for me, while not an extraordinarily tall city with sky-scrapers, there are very large swaths with 4-5 story buildings, built close together. This affords space for various uses, from housing to business, squats to co-working, markets to hackerspaces. The narrative today is represented best through the squats of yore, like Tacheles, now closed by building owners staking claim across the city to fuel business districts, housing enclaves, gentrifiers, and the many people generally coming through the city. The culture of these spaces, the mentality in various modes of collectivity, individuality and creativity remain. </p>
<p>The other theme of Berlin that cannot be over-stated is division, and return. Separation exists presently, and historically, at every layer of local life, as well as for the passing visitor like myself or any other tourist. It is a cycle of unification, (re-)purposing, and (re-)establishing divisions. The wall is demarkated, referenced, and displayed in various locations, in a sort of shattered array of a time still in living memory. Portions of the city were vacant, or used one way before, and for something else now. Old is re-used in new fashion, to benefit and detriment. </p>
<p>But enough of my urbanist suggestions. </p>
<p>Many thanks to the friends and hosts who showed me about. C-base is a space ship entrance, or a 90s scifi soundstage, or a seasoned, smoky, hacker center of international recognition and deep local value. I was lucky enough to get a tour downstairs, with a dose of lore, including that my hand-scan identified me as an alien entrant, while my crew member escorted me past various control panels in the dimly lit and hazy basement. On our way to dig out an esoteric french research book in which both c-base and sudo room are examined, we walked in to an on-going interview with the local public radio. Without skipping a beat, my host picked up a conversation in an adjacent room and swiftly ran through the boilerplate questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What&#39;s a hacker?</li>
<li>What&#39;s a hackerspace?</li>
<li>What do you do here?</li>
</ul>
<p>Flawless responses, a small move for public understanding.</p>
<p>If you are in Berlin, go to C-base, drink a mate soda, and hack the planet. Seriously. The crew-members-only basement is especially decked out—and if you can find a guide to give you a tour, it would be well worth it. The energy and thought put in over time is endearing. On the other hand, there are defiant elements that make things difficult for the space to be inclusive, despite its growth in membership and importance in global hacker and hackerspace communities. The budget is centralized, and decisions are made in a large group meeting, projects approved, and funds provided. The space is fairly do-ocratic, but there are some present functions that try on the membership. For instance, maintaining the space for public use and supporting events can wear on time and patience of members. Secondly, some take issue with pervasive cigarette smoke, necessitating a smoke-free space, AFRA. I did not get a chance to visit AFRA, but I will have to on my next return. They are fairly new and I hope they grow!</p>
<p>On the other hand, I did have a chance to stop by CCC Berlin. I found making contact with hackerspace folks in Berlin—and there are many, plus many in-between spaces—was a bit difficult. Folks generally treated spaces as clubs, where exclusivity is not just a default but sort of important. Folks were not unfriendly, it is simply that general access is not a priority, and a bit of skepticism is held. Attending events or getting in contact with individual members to show you around is a good way to get in and talk to folks. C-base is very accessible, but other than that, these spaces serve a narrow function of serving their members more than other things. </p>
<p>I had a chance to visit Potsdam, the decadant imperial city of various historical empires of the region, including San Soucci, a castle/mansion of sorts. The city was a good glimpse of the active construction and visions of the exotic and of concentrated state power. It was worth to witness such a thing, as modern (and American) imperialism is mainly dislocated, obscured, and now passive/pervasive.</p>
<p>Near the end of my stay, I attended an unanticipated event at C-base with talks from: <a href="http://vimeo.com/69582065" target="_blank">Andreas Lehner</a> of <a href="http://ccc.de/" target="_blank">CCC</a>, <a href="http://vimeo.com/69580427" target="_blank">Moritz Bratl</a> of <a href="https://www.torservers.net/" target="_blank">torservers.net</a> a non-profit that supports participation in the Tor project, and by activist <a href="http://vimeo.com/69570248" target="_blank">Jacob Applebaum</a>. I recommend watching it. The stand-out thread was the illegal PRISM program, the extent of US abuse of power including through surveillance, and asylum for Edward Snowden. You will be&mdash;should&mdash;be shocked and activated. In sum, there is more we can do to support projects like <a href="http://torproject.org/" target="_blank">Tor</a>, and protecting or saving time for people who need it most. If you are interested in teaching journalists and lawyers how to send encrypted messages, <a href="http://twitter.com/wrought" target="_blank">let me know</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, if you go to Berlin, I recommend getting around on bicycle. The public transport is very good, but moving via bicycle is a special pleasure by itself.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The train is nearly silent. There is a faint whistle, but quieter even than a rachetless-casette bike-ride through sparsely populated hills. I am on my way to Lausanne from Geneva, North of the lake. Tomorrow I will catch a bus to Berlin, which I now regret&mdash;who knows if I will get to sleep on the overnight ride, ha! Hopefully it will be worth the $70 savings? Heh, only one way to see.</p>
<h2>Hack the Planet</h2>
<p>I plan to visit <a href="http://fixme.ch/" target="_blank">fixme</a>, a hackerspace in Lausanne. While in Geneva, I had the privilege to enter Post Tenebras Lab (Latin for “after darkness” lab&mdash;a riff off a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_tenebras_lux" target="_blank">common motto</a> in Geneva) along with fellow Wikimedian/Wikipedian conference attendees Daniel Mietchen, Lane Rasberry, and Andrea Zanni. We had a tour of the infrastructure so far, an in-space-cooked dinner supplied by PTL / coordinated by Andrea, plenty of rousing conversation, and general interest in further collaborations with <a href="http://ba.chgrp.org/" target="_blank">BACH</a> and <a href="http://sudoroom.org/" target="_blank">sudo room</a>! To top it off, it turns out PTL has the exact printer necessary for the brand-new mycelia project, based on <a href="http://github.com/labitat/labitrack" target="_blank">Labitrack</a>. As soon as the code is ready, they can be off and running with a decentralized inventory tracking system.</p>
<h2>To-Do List</h2>
<ul>
<li>Research Youtube Wikimedia Commons / WikiProject Open Access video project.</li>
<li>Follow up with about consent documents project potential.</li>
<li>Do a little probing into the wordpress project.</li>
<li>Find out more info about mycelia progress.</li>
<li>Put a bit more time in to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiProject:Open_Access" target="_blank">WikiProject:Open Access</a> page.</li>
<li>Post a recap and links as result of <a href="http://twitter.com/#OAI8" target="_blank">#OAI8</a>.</li>
<li>Share photos online, but where? Maybe a gallery on here?</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Got some sleep in, not as much as I would have liked, but what can I expect having accidentally chosen ‘’the worst seat on the bus‘’ with no leg-room, haha?</p>
<p>On the other hand this bus, a new one for the agency providing me service, is more akin to an airplane in some senses. These little screens at each seat play movies, music, games, some hilarious Czech student documentaries (very odd), and six episodes of one television show: ‘’Friends‘’ ^.^ heh.</p>
<p>There was advertisement of wifi on the bus, but I was told it would only work in the Czech Republic&mdash;now that we are here, I am still waiting, with no signal from the bus… and no signal from the terminal. Hopefully bus 167 to Berlin will have wifi enabled ;).</p>
<p>Lausanne was a great time, many thanks to the folks at FixMe like Jean-Baptiste and especially Malloc, who carted me out to the countryside for a great walk through some Swiss farms and ultimately asking his girlfriend if I can crash at her house in a small village (~200 persons) outside of town. The next day he got me back to Fixme in Lausanne, we shared an excellent good fondue in the old part of town, hacked a bit on a <a href="http://ba.chgrp.org/" target="_blank">BACH</a> port of <a href="http://hackerspaces.ch" target="_blank">hackerspaces.ch</a> before I left! I hope to return, especially now knowing that the Swiss hackerspaces are learning to coordinate, starting simple through <a href="http://hackerspaces.ch/" target="_blank">hackerspaces.ch</a> (started by #fixme) as well as through a <a href="http://ccc-ch.ch/" target="_blank">CCC Switzerland</a> group. Perhaps in two years for the next #OAI8? Fixme members are more than welcome to visit the bay area&mdash;hit me up ;).</p>
<p><a href="http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/Fixme" target="_blank">Fixme</a> has an odd problem for hackerspaces. Despite being open for 3 years now and following the <a href="">hackerspace patterns</a>, the space is often closed and not used enough! They have enough full-member income to stabilize rent, even with student discounts for that tier and a second tier of membership that is cheaper. Part of the problem, they think, is that not enough folks have access. This was a bit odd to me, and upon further inquisition, it turns out a member poll they thought had attested to a lack of interest in keys was quite the opposite&mdash;people want them (glad I asked)!</p>
<p>In the meantime, they already set up a system for giving keys to folks who host events in the space, like meetups, as a way to encourage use and distribute access. Further, they are using a trust network of their membership to distribute additional keys (members get 3 keys and give 2 to people they trust). Since the keys use RFID, they can revoke access if necessary. My theory is: the ability to revoke is more useful than revoking itself. </p>
<p>So far, both PTL and Fixme are entirely men, the former has women stop by sometimes during their Tuesday dinner event, and the latter only when girlfriends of members attend (though there is one person who has been in more than a couple times). My conversations with members of both spaces indicate they think they would benefit from having different kinds of folks involved, it is just unclear how&mdash;and to me, the seeming lack of a champion. For instance, a girlfriend of one of the Fixme members drew their logo, which is a pretty cool androgynous cyborg. </p>
<p>The question is perhaps, what do folks who have already made touch points with these spaces want? How can the space be welcoming and open to their needs, interests, and beneficial additions to overall visions?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Geneva airport is not poorly designed, works well enough to get through from plane to train into the city. Not enough maps though, had to resort to the phone directions. </p>
<p>The mountainscape was an impressive view, I hope to take it all in later. Ah, the humidity is wonderful, overcast but muggy, what a pleasure!</p>
<p>Train tunnel graffiti is a familiar and welcome sight. More thoughts later, not sure when exactly is my stop.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I &lt;3 New York city. Yes, in the cheesiest possible way because I do not live there and if I did I would probably complain (an East Coast sort of thing I can understand, but with which I must strain to emphathize). It is the mark of a new New Yorker that the irks and annoyances of a rub-you-the-wrong way type of town float up to the top of your head and bubble out&mdash;least-expected&mdash;at earliest invonvenience, like what has been happening with my California transplant cousin Debbie! No need to worry, the kids are good, the neighborhood is excellent, and despite all the complexities of maximal urban density, Debbie and Marc&#39;s family is doing well, and they have <em>much</em> for which to be proud. Lucas is moving out to San Francisco this fall for school, I will see them again in August&mdash;a chance to ‘’chill out‘’ ;). </p>
<p>I get on quite well with the NY humidity, despite being a desert creature used to high and dry temperatures. I love that sweating is universal and mandatory, no ifs, ands, or buts about it, we all have to stink. But more than the weather, its the hubbub and density that prevail, lucky me only around for the bustle and none of the hussle. Quick transport, heavy on the walking, low ceilings, narrow hallways, old rickety elevators, cute little everythings, function stacking, squeezing out every ounce of space&mdash;oh, efficiency never felt so good. Cities, you have a lot to learn, it should be way easier to repurpose all these ideas and all this praxis. Perhaps such is the essence of politics, and the friction of translation. </p>
<p>The trip to and fro Newark International Airport evoked a poem:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Newark Intl &larr;&rarr; Penn Station</strong></p>
<p>A wild green and rusty old feel<br>strewn among rubble, stones, and rivulets<br>pockmarks of broken windows high on old warehouses<br>marshes and an impossible density of reeds</p>
<p>prisoners hang across the tracks<br>in a barbwire yard<br>they play basketball<br>and some just move about, slowly</p>
<p>we never see this green in the citier parts<br>but damn what a number of bricks<br>they make it easy to imagine<br>the hands it took to lay</p>
<p>a woman darts across the platform at secaucus<br>just before her, a man slipped in the train<br>from his wake, she pulls the doors open<br>barely enough to squeeze in, smiling</p>
<p>on my train<br>seated commuters return home<br>it reminds me of California trains<br>San Jose<br>San Juaquin<br>but did I mention the green? and old too…</p>
</blockquote>


<p>In an earnest effort at earliness, I showed up to the terminal 3 comfortable hours before flight time. All possible crises averted, yet, as 5:00pm approached, we already hit a number of unanticipated delays. While in New York earlier in the day, I saw an SUV pull up the street, approaching me, and thinking perhaps this driver was seeking a word, I peered into their windows, and no sooner than she came to a rest did the rear passenger door open to a young girl… expressing her upset stomach on the street. I had been wondering why the girl in the front seat was giving herself such an intense face-palm. Well little did I know this would become a theme&mdash;the plane that arrived for us to go to Geneva had what was apparently a chaotic fit of human oral excrement&mdash;to a degree requiring more than their initial cleaning attempts, but an actual carpet replacement. And finally, with our flight just stablizing in air, I see a young boy with a petrified look, shirtless, speckled with his upchuck swifted by his father to a rear restroom.</p>
<p>I actually love these humanly things very much, and am happy to see so much life exposed and unfolding. We have nothing to be ashamed of, and I wish all these sick children the best&mdash;despite arriving late for my conference on Wednesday ^.^</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Writing this on a plane, coasting over the US toward Newark, NJ where I will stay for the evening, catching a connection to Geneva tomorrow morning. Laying it all bare here (that is right folks&mdash;all honesty!), I missed my connecting flight because I showed up (on time) to Oakland Airport (OAK) rather than San Francisco (SFO). &gt;.&lt;</p>
<p>It took me all until I reached the terminals to realize there was no United airline and /no/ flight waiting for me in Oakland. </p>
<p>Luckily, I doubled-back on BART all the way to SFO, which took about 1 hour and 45 minutes, in time to at least catch a flight out to the east coast, where I can pick an early flight in the morning to Switzerland.</p>
<p>All is well that ends well right? There was no charge and the adventure indeed has begun.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Trying my first post :D</p>
<p><a href="http://getplican.com" target="_blank">Pelican</a> turned out to be a bit of a pain in the ass. No holds barred here, startup was fairly annoying and would probably be much harder for folks /completely/ unfamiliar with python applications.</p>
<p>I stepped into the <a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.2/getting_started.html#installing-pelican" target="_blank">quick-start walkthrough</a>, borrowed a few components from pelicanconf.py configuration files on the web, checked out available <a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes" target="_blank">pelican-themes</a>, and settled on a slight remix of <a href="http://github.com/shreeshga/just-read-theme.git" target="_blank">Just-Read</a> used on <a href="http://www.chippedprism.com/" target="_blank">chippedprism</a> (at least to start).</p>
<p>So why go through with it?</p>
<p>I have a several goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>Try to write more HTML5</li>
<li>Reap benefits &amp; low overhead of static content sites</li>
<li>Adopt a community-used tool for saving time/energy and using handy features</li>
<li>Strengthen my markdown skills</li>
<li>Leverage VIM more often for writing long-form text</li>
</ol>
